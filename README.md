Social Network Analysis: Misinformation vs. Normal Twitter CommunitiesThis repository contains the results and key analysis of a comparative social network study on two subgraphs from the WICO Dataset: one spreading 5G Conspiracy misinformation and one representing normal, benign discussion.Comparative Network Structure ReportIntroductionThis report analyzes and compares the structural characteristics of a malicious (5G Conspiracy) network and a benign (Normal/Non-Conspiracy) network. The analysis utilizes key network metrics calculated in Gephi to understand how the internal structure of a community impacts the diffusion and reinforcement of information.Key FindingsThe comparison reveals fundamental differences in how the two networks organize and operate, summarized by the following structural properties:MetricMisinformation (5G Conspiracy)Normal (Non-Conspiracy)Nodes / Edges16 / 2090 / 209Modularity (Q)0.2090.302Avg.

The high Average Clustering Coefficient (0.249) shows that users are strongly interconnected and cliquish, making the internal spread of the message very rapid and effective. Its low Modularity (0.209) relative to its small size, combined with only 5 Connected Components, suggests the active user base is concentrated around a few central hubs of activity.Normal Network (Non-Conspiracy): This network is much larger (90 Nodes) but less structurally cohesive. Its higher Modularity (0.302) and large number of Connected Components (30) mean the discussions are segregated and fragmented into many small, isolated groups, which is typical of decentralized, organic social media chatter. The low Average Clustering Coefficient (0.146) confirms it is not a tightly cliquish echo chamber.ConclusionThe Misinformation Graph is structurally optimized for rapid internal spread and belief reinforcement due to its high density and cliquishness. This contrasts sharply with the larger, but more fragmented and dispersed characteristics of the Normal Graph.
